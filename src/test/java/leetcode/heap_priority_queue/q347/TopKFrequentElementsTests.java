//To comprehensively test the class "TopKFrequentElements", we can include the following test cases:
//
//1. Test with a valid input array and k value:
//We can create a valid input array, such as {1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3}, and a value of k = 2. The expected output should be [1, 2] or [2, 1], as both 1 and 2 appear the same number of times in the array. We can use the assertEquals() method to compare the expected output with the actual output of the method.
//
//2. Test with an empty input array:
//We can create an empty input array and pass it to the method. The expected output should be an empty list. We can use the assertEquals() method to compare the expected output with the actual output of the method.
//
//3. Test with a negative k value:
//We can pass a negative value of k to the method and ensure that it throws an IllegalArgumentException. We can use the assertThrows() method to verify that the expected exception is thrown.
//
//4. Test with a k value larger than the length of the input array:
//We can pass a k value that is larger than the length of the input array and ensure that the method throws an IllegalArgumentException. We can use the assertThrows() method to verify that the expected exception is thrown.
//
//5. Test with an input array containing duplicate elements:
//We can create an input array with duplicate elements and a value of k = 3. The expected output should contain three elements with the highest frequency of occurrence in the input array. We can use the assertEquals() method to compare the expected output with the actual output of the method.
//
//6. Test with a null input array:
//We can pass a null input array and ensure that the method throws a NullPointerException. We can use the assertThrows() method to verify that the expected exception is thrown.
//
//7. Test with a large input array:
//We can create a large input array with thousands of elements and pass it to the method. The expected output should still be correct, regardless of the size of the input array. We can use the assertEquals() method to compare the expected output with the actual output of the method.
//
//8. Test with an input array containing negative numbers:
//We can create an input array with negative numbers and a value of k = 2. The expected output should be [1, -2] or [-2, 1], as both 1 and -2 appear the same number of times in the array. We can use the assertEquals() method to compare the expected output with the actual output of the method.
//
//9. Test with an input array containing only one element:
//We can create an input array with a single element and a value of k = 1. The expected output should be [1] or [-1], depending on the value of the element. We can use the assertEquals() method to compare the expected output with the actual output of the method.
//
//10. Test with an input array containing all unique elements:
//We can create an input array with all unique elements and a value of k = 3. The expected output should be a list with three distinct elements from the input array. We can use the assertEquals() method to compare the expected output with the actual output of the method.
//
//11. Test with an input array containing all equal elements:
//We can create an input array with all equal elements and a value of k = 1. The expected output should be [1] or [-1], depending on the value of the element. We can use the assertEquals() method to compare the expected output with the actual output of the method.
