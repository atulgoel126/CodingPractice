Question: Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II

Given an array of stock prices for consecutive days, find the maximum profit that can be made by buying and selling stocks. Unlike in the "Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock" question, in this case, you can make multiple transactions (i.e., buy and sell multiple times). However, you must complete the current transaction before starting a new one. Therefore, you cannot buy and then sell on the same day.

Example:

Input: [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 7
Explanation:
Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 3 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
Buy on day 4 (price = 3) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-3 = 3.
Total profit = 4 + 3 = 7.

Note: You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (i.e., you must sell the stock before buying again).
