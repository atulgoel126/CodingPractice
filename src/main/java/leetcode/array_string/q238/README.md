#Product of Array Except Self

Given an array of n integers, return an array output such that output[i] is equal to the product of all elements of nums except nums[i].

Note: Please solve it without division and in O(n) runtime.

Example:

Input:  [1,2,3,4]
Output: [24,12,8,6]

Constraints:
- The length of the given array is at least 2 and does not exceed 100.
- The values of the input array are guaranteed to be in the range [0, 10^6].
