# Container With Most Water

You are given an array of positive integers representing the heights of vertical lines on a container. The width of each line is 1 unit. Find the maximum amount of water that can be contained in the container by selecting two lines from the array, where the distance between the two lines is at least 1 unit. Note: You may not slant the container. 

Example:
Input: [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
Output: 49
Explanation: The max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49, as two lines of height 8 are 8 units apart.
