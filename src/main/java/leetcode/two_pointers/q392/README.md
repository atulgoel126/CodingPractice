# Is Subsequence

## Description
Given two strings s and t, return true if s is a subsequence of t, or false otherwise.

A subsequence of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. 

For example, "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" because "ace" can be formed by deleting the character "b" from "abcde," but "aec" is not a subsequence of "abcde" because the characters are not in the same order as they appear in the original string.

## Examples:
Input: s = "abc", t = "ahbgdc"
Output: true

Input: s = "axc", t = "ahbgdc"
Output: false
