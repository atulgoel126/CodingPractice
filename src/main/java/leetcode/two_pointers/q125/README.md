# Valid Palindrome

Given a string s, determine if it is a palindrome, considering only alphanumeric characters and ignoring cases.

A palindrome is a word, phrase, or sequence that reads the same backward as forward, e.g., madam or racecar.

Note: For the purpose of this problem, we define empty string as valid palindrome.

Example 1:
Input: s = "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama"
Output: true

Example 2:
Input: s = "race a car"
Output: false

Constraints:
- 1 <= s.length <= 2 * 105
- s consists only of printable ASCII characters.
