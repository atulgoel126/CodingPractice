# Kth Smallest Element in a BST

Given a binary search tree (BST), find the kth smallest element in it.

Note:
You may assume k is always valid, 1 ≤ k ≤ BST's total elements.

Example 1:

Input: root = [3,1,4,null,2], k = 1
   3
  / \
 1   4
  \
   2
Output: 1

Example 2:

Input: root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,null,1], k = 3
       5
      / \
     3   6
    / \
   2   4
  /
 1
Output: 3

Follow up:
What if the BST is modified (insert/delete operations) often and you need to find the kth smallest frequently? How would you optimize the kthSmallest routine? 

This is a common problem that you may come across while solving Data Structure problems on LeetCode or other coding platforms. The problem essentially asks for the kth smallest element in a Binary Search Tree (BST). The input consists of the root node of a BST and an integer k, and the output should be the kth smallest element in the BST.

The given example 1 and example 2 provide a visual representation of a BST with the expected output.

Additionally, the question poses a follow-up question of how to optimize the solution if the BST is frequently modified (e.g. with insert/delete operations). This could be helpful in a real-world scenario where the BST represents a continuously updated data structure.

To solve this problem, it is important to understand the properties of a BST, such as its sorted nature, where the smallest element is always found on the left subtree and the larger elements are on the right subtree. Applying this knowledge, a possible approach could involve in-order traversal of the BST and keeping track of the elements as they are visited. Once the kth element is reached, that would be the answer.

In this format, the information regarding the problem, input, output, and potential approach can be found, making it easier to understand and solve the problem.
