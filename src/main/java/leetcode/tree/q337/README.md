# House Robber III

## Description

You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed, the only constraint stopping you from robbing each of them is that adjacent houses have a security system connected, and it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were robbed on the same night.

Given a binary tree representing the houses on a street, determine the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight without alerting the police. The binary tree structure cannot be modified.
