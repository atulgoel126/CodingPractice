## Maximum Width of Binary Tree

Given a binary tree, write a function to find the maximum width of the given tree. The maximum width of a tree is defined as the maximum number of nodes in any level of the tree, starting from the root node to the furthest leaf node. If there are more than one level with the maximum width, the level closer to the root node is considered. 

Example: 
Input:
          1
        /   \
       3     2
      / \     \
     5   3     9

Output: 4 (Level 3 has the maximum width with 4 nodes) 

Note: The input is a binary tree with non-empty nodes and is guaranteed to fit in the 32-bit signed integer range.
