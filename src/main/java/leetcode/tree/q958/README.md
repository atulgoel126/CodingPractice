# Check Completeness of a Binary Tree

Given a binary tree, determine if it is a complete binary tree.

A complete binary tree is a binary tree in which every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible. It can have between 1 and 2h nodes inclusive at the last level h.

Example 1:

Input: [1,2,3,4,5,6]
Output: true
Explanation: Every level except the last is completely filled, and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible.

Example 2:

Input: [1,2,3,4,5,null,7]
Output: false
Explanation: The last level is not as far left as possible.
