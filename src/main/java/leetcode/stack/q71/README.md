# Simplify Path

Given an absolute path for a file (Unix-style), simplify it. Or in other words, convert it to the canonical path.

In a Unix-style file system, a period '.' refers to the current directory, a double period '..' refers to the directory up a level, and any multiple consecutive slashes (i.e. '//') are treated as a single slash '/'. For this problem, any other format of periods such as '...' are treated as file/directory names.

The canonical path should have the following format:
- The path starts with a single slash '/'.
- Any two directories are separated by a single slash '/'.
- The path does not end with a trailing '/'.
- The path only contains the directories on the path from the root directory to the target file or directory (i.e., no symbolic links or shortcuts).

Return the simplified canonical path.
