## Kth Largest Element in An Unsorted Array

Find the <strong>k</strong><sup>th</sup> largest element in an unsorted array. Note that it is the kth largest element in the sorted order, not the kth distinct element.

<strong>Example 1:</strong>
```
Input: [3,2,1,5,6,4] and k = 2
Output: 5
```

<strong>Example 2:</strong>
```
Input: [3,2,3,1,2,4,5,5,6] and k = 4
Output: 4
```

<strong>Note:</strong>
You may assume k is always valid, 1 ≤ k ≤ array's length.


## Debug
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int findKthLargest(vector<int>& nums, int k) {

    }
};
```
