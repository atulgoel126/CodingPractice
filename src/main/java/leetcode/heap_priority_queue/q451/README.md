# Title: Sort Characters By Frequency
# Description:
Given a string, sort it in decreasing order based on the frequency of characters.

Example 1:
Input: "tree"
Output: "eert" 
Explanation: 'e' appears twice while 'r' and 't' both appear once. So 'e' must appear before both 'r' and 't'. Therefore, "eetr" is also a valid answer. 

Example 2:
Input: "cccaaa"
Output: "cccaaa"
Explanation: Both 'c' and 'a' appear three times, so "cccaaa" is also a valid answer. Note that "aaaccc" is not valid, as the order of the characters matters. 

Example 3:
Input: "Aabb"
Output: "bbAa"
Explanation: "bbaA" is also a valid answer, but "Aabb" is incorrect. Note that 'A' and 'a' are treated as two different characters.
