# Top K Frequent Elements
Given a non-empty array of integers, find the top k most frequent elements.

Note:
- You may assume k is always valid, 1 ≤ k ≤ number of unique elements.
- Your algorithm's time complexity must be better than O(n log n), where n is the array's size.

Example 1:
Input: [1,1,1,2,2,3], k = 2
Output: [1,2]

Example 2:
Input: [1,2,2,3,3,4,4,4,5,5], k = 3
Output: [4,2,3]
