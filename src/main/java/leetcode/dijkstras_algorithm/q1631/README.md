# Path With Minimum Effort

Given a 2D array of integers `heights` representing the elevation map of a grid, find a path from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner with minimum effort.

Each step along the path, the effort expended by moving from one cell to another is the maximum of the absolute difference in heights between the two cells.

Return the minimum effort needed to travel from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner of the grid.
