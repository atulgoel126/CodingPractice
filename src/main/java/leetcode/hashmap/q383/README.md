# Ransom Note
Leetcode link: https://leetcode.com/problems/ransom-note/

## Description:
Given a string representing the contents of a ransom note and another string representing the contents of a magazine, determine if the ransom note can be constructed from the magazines' characters.

Each letter from the magazine can only be used once in the ransom note. All letters are case sensitive.

## Example:

### Input:
1. String `ransomNote`: "a"
2. String `magazine`: "b"

### Output:
False

Explanation:
The letter "a" is not present in the magazine, so the ransom note cannot be constructed.

## Constraints:
- You may assume that both strings contain only lowercase letters.
- `ransomNote` and `magazine` have a length of 1 to 10000.
