# Coin Change

Given a set of coin denominations and a total amount of money, find the minimum number of coins needed to make up that amount. If it is not possible to make the amount, return -1.

Example:
Input: coins = [1,2,5], amount = 11
Output: 3 
Explanation: 11 = 5 + 5 + 1

Note:
- You may assume that you have an infinite number of each kind of coin.
- All coins have positive integer value and at most 5000.
- The amount is non-negative and less than 1000000.
