Title: Target Sum

Description:
Given an array of integers and a target integer, find two numbers in the array that add up to the target sum. Return the indices of the two numbers as an array. It is guaranteed that there is only one unique solution and the same element cannot be used twice.

Example:
Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: The sum of 2 and 7 is 9, therefore the indices of 2 and 7 are 0 and 1 respectively.
