# Partition Equal Subset Sum

Given a non-empty array, nums, of positive integers, determine if it can be partitioned into two subsets such that the sum of elements in both subsets is equal.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,5,11,5]
Output: true
Explanation: The array can be partitioned into [1,5,5] and [11] with equal sums of 11.

Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,5]
Output: false
Explanation: The array cannot be partitioned into equal subsets.

Note:

- Each element in nums will be an integer.
- The length of nums will be in the range [1, 100].
