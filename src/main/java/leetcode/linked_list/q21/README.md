## Merge Two Sorted Lists
Given two sorted lists of integers `l1` and `l2`, merge them into a single sorted list and return it.

Example:
Input: l1 = [1,2,4], l2 = [1,3,4]
Output: [1,1,2,3,4,4]

Note:
- The input lists may be null or empty, in which case return the other list.
- The lists may not be of equal length.
- The lists may contain duplicate numbers.
- An efficient solution should run in O(m+n) time, where m and n are the lengths of the two lists.
