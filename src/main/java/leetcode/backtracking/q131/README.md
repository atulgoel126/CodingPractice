Problem Name: Palindrome Partitioning

Description: Given a string s, partition it such that every substring of the partition is a palindrome. Return all possible palindrome partitioning of s.

Example:

Input: "aab"
Output: 
[
  ["a","a","b"],
  ["aa","b"]
]

Explanation:
There are two possible ways to partition the string "aab" into palindromes:
1. ["a","a","b"] - each substring is a palindrome
2. ["aa","b"] - "aa" is a palindrome and "b" is a palindrome
