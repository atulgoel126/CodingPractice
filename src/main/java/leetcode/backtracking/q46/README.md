Question: 
Permutations

Given a collection of distinct integers, return all possible permutations.

Example 1:
Input: [1,2,3]
Output: 
[
  [1,2,3],
  [1,3,2],
  [2,1,3],
  [2,3,1],
  [3,1,2],
  [3,2,1]
]

Example 2:
Input: [0,1]
Output: 
[
  [0,1],
  [1,0]
]

Explanation: The goal of this question is to find all possible combinations of the given integers without repeating any number in a single permutation. The output should be a 2D array containing all the possible permutations.
