# Combination Sum

Given a set of candidate numbers (candidates) and a target number (target), find all unique combinations in candidates where the candidate numbers sum to target.

The same repeated number may be chosen from candidates unlimited times.

Note: All numbers (including target) will be positive integers. 
The solution set must not contain duplicate combinations.

Example 1:

Input: candidates = [2,3,6,7], target = 7
Output: [[2,2,3],[7]]

Explanation:
2 and 3 are candidates, and they sum up to 5.
Another two candidates, 2 and 3, create 6.
Lastly, 2 and 7 create 7.
Note that 2 can be used multiple times.

Example 2:

Input: candidates = [2,3,5], target = 8
Output: [[2,2,2,2],[2,3,3],[3,5]]

Explanation:
2 and 3 are candidates, and they add up to 5.
Another three candidates, 2, 3, and 5, create 8.
Finally, 2 can be used multiple times to create 8.
Note:
1. All numbers (including target) will be positive integers.
2. The solution set must not contain duplicate combinations.
