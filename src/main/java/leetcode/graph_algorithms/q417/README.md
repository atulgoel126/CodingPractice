**Question description:**
Pacific Atlantic Water Flow is a Leetcode problem that asks you to find the indices of the cells in a 2D matrix where water can flow from the Pacific Ocean to the Atlantic Ocean and vice versa. These cells must also satisfy the condition that they can only flow to cells with equal or lower heights. The matrix is represented by a 2D array and the indices of the cells should be returned in the form of a list of coordinates. The matrix size will not exceed 200 x 200 and each element will be an integer representing the height of the cell. This problem aims to test your knowledge of 2D arrays, graph theory and depth-first search algorithms.
